# WorldTimeBoy Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** January 2026

## Introduction

WorldTimeBoy ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our Chrome Extension.

## Information We Collect

WorldTimeBoy collects and stores the following information **locally on your device**:

1. **Timezone List**: The list of timezones you add to the extension
2. **User Preferences**: Your preference for 12-hour or 24-hour time format
3. **Timezone Labels**: Custom labels you assign to timezones (if any)
4. **Timezone Order**: The order in which you arrange your timezones

## How We Use Your Information

All information collected by WorldTimeBoy is used **solely** for the following purposes:

- Displaying multiple timezones in the extension interface
- Remembering your time format preference (12-hour or 24-hour)
- Maintaining your custom timezone list and settings
- Preserving your preferred timezone order

## Data Storage

**All data is stored locally on your device** using Chrome's local storage API (`chrome.storage.local`). 

- **No data is transmitted to any external servers**
- **No data is shared with third parties**
- **No data is collected for analytics or advertising purposes**

## Data Access

WorldTimeBoy requires the `storage` permission to:
- Save your timezone list and preferences locally on your device
- Retrieve your saved settings when you open the extension

This permission is necessary for the extension to function properly and remember your preferences.

## Your Rights

You have complete control over your data:

- **View your data**: You can view all stored data through Chrome's extension storage inspector
- **Delete your data**: You can remove timezones or reset preferences at any time through the extension interface
- **Uninstall**: Uninstalling the extension will remove all locally stored data

## Third-Party Services

WorldTimeBoy does not use any third-party services, analytics tools, or advertising networks. The extension operates entirely offline and does not require an internet connection to function (except for initial timezone data lookup).

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.
